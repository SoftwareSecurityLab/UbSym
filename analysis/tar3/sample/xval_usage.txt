xval usage:

xval is now compatible with both tar2(v2.2) and tar3(tar2r version)

Command line parameters:
       xval -p filestem N:      perform datafile split on filestem.data
       xval tar2 filestem N:    N-way validation with tar2 on filestem
       xval tar2r filestem N:   N-way validation with tar2r on filestem

    Specify path for tar2/tar2r/filestem if they are in different folders.

exp:
   c:\prog\xvalnew\debug\xval.exe      c:\prog\tar2r\debug\tar2.exe     iris                10
     (path for xval)                             (path for tar2)                        (filestem=iris)        (N=10)
        
A easy way to perform the xval trial is to copy tar2.exe and xval.exe and 
all the data files into the same the directory and issue the command:
          xval tar2 filestem N

xval first splits the data file in to N .data file and N.test files, which results in:
       XDF[0..N-1].data
       XDF[0..N-1].test
    (Note: old xval results in XDF.data[0..N-1] and XDF.test[0..N-1]

Then xval invokes tar2 or tar3 N times, generates N result files and one summary file.

After done, it automatically delete XDF*.data and XDF*.test
